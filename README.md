# htmldown
custom markdown to html converter, specifically for my site.
it's basically a wrapper for python-markdown.
it only does one file at a time, this is intentional i promise.

there's also rss_builder.py which reads a toml file, and through brute force turns it into an rss xml file. you can see this in action [on my websites repo](https://github.com/blltrx/sitemd).
